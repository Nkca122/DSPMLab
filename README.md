2. Find out all dupliactes of an array

3. Merge two arrays

4. Interchange two arrays

5. find the maximum and minimum of two arrays

6. Stack implementation
7. Queue implementation

## b. Pointers:

3. Bubble sort

4. Call by value, call by ref
        
## c. Calloc and malloc:
1. Demonstarte the usage and differnce btw malloc and calloc function, finally implement the free function to show that the pointers are released from memeory allocation

2. Create a copy of an array and store in another one
3. Implement reversal of a string allocated with calloc

4. Create an array using dynamic memeory allocation, such that every index has another array of size n

5. Implement stack and queue using memory allocation

## d. Structures
1. What is a structure in C programming  & how it is used ?
