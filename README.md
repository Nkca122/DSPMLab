# DSPM Lab all practicals
## a. Arrays:
1. Reverse an array

2. Find out all dupliactes of an array

3. Merge two arrays

4. Interchange two arrays

5. find the maximum and minimum of two arrays

6. Stack implementation
7. Queue implementation

## b. Pointers:
1. Table of a number

2. Input array 
3. Bubble sort

4. Call by value, call by ref
        
## c. Calloc and malloc:
1. Demonstarte the usage and differnce btw malloc and calloc function, finally implement the free function to show that the pointers are released from memeory allocation

2. Create a copy of an array and store in another one
3. Implement reversal of a string allocated with calloc

4. Create an array using dynamic memeory allocation, such that every index has another array of size n

5. Implement stack and queue using memory allocation

## d. Structures
1. What is a structure in C programming  & how it is used ?

2. What is the difference between a structure and a class in c ?

3. How to dynamically allocate memeory for a structure in c ?

4. implement a structure, mobile phones, create an array of structure then read the data and display them in table format

5. Create a user defined data type to accept data about `N` students perform the following operations
> - Create
> - Modify
> - delete
> - display


**NOTE**: use a menu driven approach for this programm

6. Using DMA create a structure, for movies

**NOTE**: use a menu driven approach for this programm

7. Using a pointer to structure , define a structure called `Cars`, collect data about `N` cars and display them
